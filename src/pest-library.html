                        Fleas are small, flightless parasites that feed on the blood of various warm-blooded animals, depending on the species, and do transmit diseases to their host. Although most people think of fleas as a problem only for the family pet, they can also bite humans and are the most common transmitter of the Rare Bubonic Plague. The plague persists in nature by infecting wild rodents—including mice, rats, squirrels, chipmunks, groundhogs, and prairie dogs—and their fleas. Fleas that have fed on infected rodents can spread the infection to humans and other animals by biting them. Humans can also get the plague through direct contact with infected animals, both living and dead. This includes handling infected animals, coming into contact with their tissues or bodily fluids, eating infected animals, being bitten or scratched by infected animals, or inhaling infectious respiratory droplets. People can also be exposed to plague via their pets if they’ve acquired fleas from infected wild animals or been infected themselves. Call us for all your flea solutions.

                        Rodents can be difficult to keep out of living abodes. mice can squeeze through spaces as small as a dime and rats can fit through holes the size of a quarter to enter your premise. There are various species of mice, but the most commonly found species in our part of the world are the roof mice and the house mouse. The house mouse is a small rodent that is nearly hairless and has a slightly pointed black nose with slightly protruding eyes and large ears. They range in color from very light brown to black and normally have a gray belly or buff belly. The droppings are black and have a nasty smell.

                        Non-biting flies, such as houseflies, are not only nuisance pests, but they are also responsible for transmitting diseases and contaminating food. Flies are capable of contaminating food and transferring more than 100 disease pathogens. Food contamination is the most reasons why fly control should be extremely important in every home or restaurant. Flies are attracted to decaying organic material such as garbage bins, leftover food, dead animal or plant material. Contaminated food can cause diarrhea and stomach disorders.
